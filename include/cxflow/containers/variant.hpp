// A closed-set typed value: the base storage unit for variant_map entries
// (see variant_map.hpp) and observable object properties (see object.hpp).
// No std::any/type-erasure escape hatch - matches structure.hpp's existing
// "no dynamic GValue-equivalent type system yet (deferred)" stance. Widen
// the base's scalar alternatives if/when a new field type is actually
// needed, rather than adding an open-ended fallback now.
//
// Closed set is bool/int64_t/uint64_t/double_t/string plus the two
// self-referential aggregate alternatives below. Any argument not
// implicitly, non-narrowingly convertible to one of the seven alternatives
// simply fails to compile at the call site, same as passing an unrelated
// type to a bare std::variant of these alternatives would.
//
// int64_t was added alongside uint64_t (SRS-001 OPEN-6, resolved: widen
// rather than scope negative values out) so that structure::field_value's
// signed 64-bit integer alternative has a lossless home here - a
// structure/caps field holding a negative value, or an element property
// that needs a signed sentinel (e.g. fake_src's num-buffers, where -1 means
// "unbounded"), now round-trips exactly instead of wrapping into a huge
// unsigned value or being rejected outright. Callers must still pass an
// exact-width, exact-signedness integer literal (std::int64_t{...} /
// std::uint64_t{...}), never a bare int/long: with two integral
// alternatives of equal conversion rank now present, an implicitly-widened
// argument is ambiguous between them (the same reason a bare string
// literal already had to be reasoned about via P0608 below) - this was
// already the project's convention before this alternative was added, not
// a new restriction it introduces.
//
// Publicly inherits std::variant instead of wrapping it, so the whole
// standard variant interface applies directly to this type: std::get,
// std::get_if, std::holds_alternative, std::visit, and operator== all work
// on a `variant` exactly as they would on a bare std::variant, found via
// template argument deduction through the (unique, public) base class and
// via ADL considering base classes - no bespoke get<T>()/holds<T>()
// re-implementation needed. `using base::base;` inherits std::variant's
// constructors as-is, including its converting constructor, which already
// excludes binding to another `variant` (so copy/move still go through the
// implicit special members, not the converting constructor) and already
// carries the C++20 fix (P0608) that makes a `const char*` prefer the
// std::string alternative over bool - without it, `variant v = "hello";`
// would silently pick the pre-P0608 boolean-conversion candidate instead
// of constructing a string.
//
// std::deque<variant> (an ordered list of variants) and
// std::map<std::string, variant> (a string-keyed, key-sorted collection of
// variants) make variant self-referential, with no pointer/indirection
// wrapper needed: std::deque tolerates an incomplete element type at the
// point it's instantiated (a guarantee deque/list/forward_list/vector
// specifically have - std::map is not guaranteed this by the standard),
// and in practice libstdc++'s and libc++'s std::map do not require the
// mapped type to be complete merely to be named as a variant alternative
// here either, since sizeof(map<K, V>) does not depend on sizeof(V).
// Verified to compile on GCC 16 and Clang 22 in C++23.
